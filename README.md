# Discord-Chat-Box
Random program I made for Discord Streams
# Prerequisites: 
> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)<br>
> The node modules Express, Discord.js, and Socket.io<br>
> A Discord bot that you have the token for (Make one [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications))<br>
**Prerequisite/file setup [here](prereq-setup.md)**
# How to use:
1) After downloading the files, open command prompt and do `cd C:\Users\(your name)\(your folder)`
2) Then run `node DiscordChat.js`
3) Go to your browser and open `http://localhost:3000`
4) In discord, run the command `&setchannel` in the channel you want to capture (you should see the messages pop up in the window)
5) (optional) For OBS, if you want a transparent background, make a window capture, crop out the top of the browser, and then go to filters
6) Add a color key (not chroma), (note to self, fill in later)
